# Quantum parameter estimation using Bayesian learning 
## (Alexandra's Master's project)

The most up to date file is `precession_2d.py` which estimates a precession frequency plus a decay factor. 

`precession_1d.py` estimates the frequency only, assuming a decoherence-free system.

`likelihoodfree.py` is similar to `precession_1d.py `, but doesn't rely on the reconstruction of the likelihood function 
(requiring only a sample outcome per particle per step).
