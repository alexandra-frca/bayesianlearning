The notebook `IBMQ_experiments.ipynb` has some experiments on IBMQ devices using OpenPulse. Some of these experiments are meant to collect data for inference of ω, ω and T2*, T1 or T2.

The folder **IMBQ data** holds folders with a representative selection of these data vectors.

All the other files are adapted from some other repository folder to use these real datasets or collect data real time, and barely have changes other than that.

The attemps at MCMC are just drafts and don't perform well like SMC.
