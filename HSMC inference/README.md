The file `multi_dim_cosine_sum.py` performs inference on the *n* parameters of a univariate probability distribution given by a normalized sum of *n* squared cosines. The 1-d case reduces to that of `Precession frequency estimation/precession_1d_HSMC.py`, apart from some differences in the implementation and plotted quantities.

The file `multivariate_cosine.py` does the same, but for a multivariate distribution consisting of a binomial distribution along each dimension (with the probability of success a squared cosine).
