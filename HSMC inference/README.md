The folder `multi_dim_cosine_sum.py` performs inference on the *n* parameters of a univariate probability distribution given by a normalized sum of *n* squared cosines. The 1-d case reduces to that of `Precession frequency estimation/precession_1d_HSMC.py`, apart from some extra flexibility in the implementation and differences in the plotted quantities.
