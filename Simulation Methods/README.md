## Test cases for simulation/sampling methods

A set of implementations based on examples from [Inference with Hamiltonian Sequential Monte Carlo Simulators](http://www.remidaviet.com/files/HSMC-paper.pdf), taking on 3 different target densities (divided by folders) and using several approaches based on either Metropolis-Hastings Monte Carlo or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo: simple chains for the 6-d gaussian and the Rosenbrock function, and parallel/sequential methods for the multimodal smiley target density estimate. Also includes some files used to generate data.
