## Phase estimation

*Information theory* phase estimation as described in [Faster Phase Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1304.0741.pdf).

The file `phase_estimation_GRF.py` uses gaussian rejection filtering (based on [Efficient Bayesian Phase Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.00869.pdf)), while `phase_estimation_MCMC.py` relies on MCMC (with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and Metropolis-Hastings transitions) for the approximate inference.
